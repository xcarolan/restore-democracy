Luna Rainbow is a fierce advocate for marginalized voices and radical social change. Their work focuses on exposing systemic oppression, corporate exploitation, and the urgent need for complete societal transformation to address climate catastrophe.

A former organizer for various direct-action movements, Luna brings their activist experience to their journalism, believing that objectivity in reporting is a myth that serves the status quo. They specialize in covering protests, mutual aid initiatives, and exposing what they term "late-stage capitalism's death spiral."
