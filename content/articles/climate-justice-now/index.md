In a powerful display of intersectional resistance, over 200 water protectors and climate justice activists successfully blocked construction of the Colonial Pipeline Corporation's latest ecological assault on unceded indigenous territories. This direct action represents a crucial convergence of decolonial struggle and climate justice organizing.

## Capitalism's Climate Catastrophe

The fossil fuel industry's continued expansion in the face of climate collapse reveals the fundamental contradiction of extractive capitalism:

- Indigenous communities bear the immediate impact
- Corporate profits prioritized over planetary survival
- Systemic environmental racism in infrastructure planning
- Police militarization protecting corporate interests

## Voices from the Frontlines

"We're not just fighting a pipeline – we're fighting for survival," explains Sarah Redfeather (they/them), an indigenous youth organizer. "These corporations are perpetuating colonial violence through environmental destruction."

## Community Power in Action

The successful blockade demonstrates the effectiveness of horizontal organizing and mutual aid networks:

1. Rapid response signal boosting
2. Community kitchen supporting protesters
3. Legal aid collective providing know-your-rights training
4. Medic teams ensuring protester safety

## Moving Forward

The climate crisis demands immediate systemic change. Reform is not enough – we need complete transformation of our relationship with the Earth and each other. The time for radical climate action is now.

Join us this Saturday for a direct action training and decolonial climate justice workshop at the People's Community Center.
