You either believe in democracy and all it stands for, or you don't. Despite the
noise from politicians, pundits, and media misdirection, the voting booth choice
comes down to a fundamental question about American governance.

Both parties have made missteps over the years, but this moment is different.
Today's Republican party has embraced authoritarian tactics: refusing to accept
legitimate election results, supporting efforts to overturn the 2020 election,
proposing to use presidential power against political opponents, and praising
dictators abroad. These aren't abstract concerns—they represent a clear
departure from democratic norms that have held for generations.

The Democratic party, despite its many issues and policy disagreements you may
have with it, still operates within democratic frameworks. It accepts election
outcomes, supports peaceful transfers of power, and maintains institutional
checks and balances.

This isn't about policy preferences on taxes, healthcare, or
immigration—reasonable people disagree on those issues. This is about whether we
preserve a system where voters decide outcomes and power changes hands
peacefully, or whether we accept a model where one leader or party places itself
above democratic accountability.

If you value American democracy, the choice is clear. Everything else is noise.
